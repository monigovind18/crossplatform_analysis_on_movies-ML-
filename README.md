# Cross-Platform Analysis for Amazon Movie Subscribers

This project involves analyzing data to understand the relationship between YouTube trending movies and Amazon movie subscribers. The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of data preparation, analysis, and model building. The tasks are performed using Python, and the final recommendation system is deployed using Streamlit.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Data Preparation
- *Objective:* Clean and preprocess the YouTube trending movies dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.
- *Steps:*
  1. *Load the Dataset:* Use pandas to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
  2. *Inspect the Data:* Identify and handle null values.
  3. *Save the Cleaned Data:* Save the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- *Objective:* Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the main characteristics of the dataset.
- *Steps:*
  1. *Load the Dataset*
  2. *Univariate Analysis:* Analyze individual features using summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots).
  3. *Summarize Findings:* Document key insights and findings from the EDA.

### Task 3: Data Pre-processing
- *Objective:* Perform data pre-processing using NLP techniques like TF-IDF for reviews.

### Task 4: Model Building
- *Objective:* Build a recommendation model using either a content-based or collaborative filtering approach.
- *Steps:*
  1. *Model Implementation:* Develop the model.
  2. *Web UI:* Display the recommended results using Streamlit.
  3. *Code Submission:* Submit the complete code.

### Task 5: Reflection on the Tasks
- *Objective:* Write 5 to 10 lines about the understanding of each task and the challenges faced during the project.

### Task 6: Support Requirement
- *Objective:* Indicate whether trainer support is needed and specify the areas where assistance is required.
